
AttributeOverrides and Embedded Object Keys

----------------

Suppose we have two addresses one is home and another one is office address, 
In this scenario table column names should be different for home and office addresses, 
we can override the table column name using annotation @AttributeOverrides.
@AttributeOverrides({
                @AttributeOverride(name="street", column=@Column(name="HOME_STREET_NAME")),
                @AttributeOverride(name="city", column=@Column(name="HOME_CITY_NAME")),
                @AttributeOverride(name="state", column=@Column(name="HOME_STATE_NAME")),
                @AttributeOverride(name="pincode", column=@Column(name="HOME_PIN_CODE")),
})
@EmbeddedId: It is used when you want to use an object as primary key instead of @Id and that object is 
the combination of all member variables and it should be unique.

Eg:
@EmbeddedID
private LoginUser userId;
Above annotation are used to override column names in database.

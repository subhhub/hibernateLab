Q: Explain about O/R mismatch?

Ans:  There exist paradigm(principal) mismatch (impedance mismatch) between object oriented and relation representation of data in an enterprise application.

Most notable mismatches are
1.	Problem of granularity
2.	Problem of subtypes (inheritance mismatch)
3.	Problem of relationship (relation mismatch)

Relative size of the data with which we are working is known as granularity.

Data are(is) both course grained and fine grained.

If UDT(user defined datatype) is the column type of a table it is set to be course grained, if no table column is of UDT, that table is set to be fine grained. 

Course grained table in RDBMS has not consistent support and therefore almost abandoned.

If UDT is a data member in a persistent class it is set to be course grained.

If no data member is a UDT is a persistent class, it is said to be fined grained.

drop table employee;
create table employee 
	(empno number(8) primary key, 
	name varchar(12), 
	salary number(8,2), 
	deptno varchar(4),
	hno varchar(20),
	street varchar(12),
	city varchar(15),
	pin varchar(6)
	);

insert into employee values(1001, 'subh', 40000, 111, 420, 'east turn', 'hyderabad', '500038');
insert into employee values(1002, 'sanj', 30000, 111, 420, 'east turn', 'hyderabad', '500038');
